## DriverPass

DriverPass is a company looking to implement a system that will provide a platform for users to take online classes and practice tests to better prepare for the DMV driving test. They would like clients to have the ability to go online and book two-hour time blocks for a driving lesson using their account.

I feel as though my functional and non-functional requirements were done well. I wish that my UML charts were a little better. I believe they were sufficient, tt was fun doing them, and it realyy helped me understand the pre-work that takes place before any code is written.

Interpretting the User's needs involves listening carefully to the requirements. This sounds simple but is often overlooked. Pay attentention to detail and gather all requirements. The team worked together collaboratively in an Agile framework to employ an iterative approach that ensures that the system meets the user's requirements and is easy to use.

## Best Way to Approach Designing Software

1. Gather requirements
2. Define the problem
3. Identify the architecture
4. Design the user interface
5. Choose the technology stack
6. Create a detailed design
7. Write the code
8. Test the software
9. Deploy and maintain the software
